/**
    \file movegeneration.h

    \brief File containing the  functions used to generate all the pseudo legals moves in a given chess position, as well as the functions to evaluate checks.

    Generating pseudo legal moves means that all the moves generated follow all the rules of chess, except for pins, meaning that a move which puts its own king in check can
    and will also be generated. Those cases are truncated by the search algorithm.
